## Installation<a name="installation"></a>

Python version should be 3.7+. There are no other libraries to install. Anaconda distribution should cover it all.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This project is created to answer the following questions using StackOverflow's developer surveys from 2018 to 2020:

* Which languages have been used the most each year?
* Which ones have been most unwanted?
* How do the salaries compare between the two - most worked with and most dreaded?


Based on the answer of these questions, I further am motivated to answer a bigger question - Which programming language should one learn first?

## File Descriptions<a name="desc"></a>

There's only one Python notebook covering the answers to the questions raised. The notebook contains the necessary comments to help understand the code and the thought process around it.
The notebook reads data from directory `survey_results` containing csv files named in format `survey_{year}.csv`
The data can be found [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey).

## Results<a name="results"></a>

[This blog post](https://sachinkukreja.medium.com/which-language-should-i-learn-first-cde86127941e) describes all the findings through the analysis.

## Licensing, Authors and Acknowledgements<a name="license"></a>
